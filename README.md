# lafortuna-lcd
- This is my attempt at understanding and documenting everything in the LCD driver
- Currently the main driver is comprehensively commented with as much as I can work out
- In the future I plan to write the documentation as markdown or similar, as well as implement cool features

## Features Planned
- Buttons
- More shapes
  - Outlined rectangle
  - Circles
  - Colour effects, e.g. rainbows and gradients
